📑 Deck:

**Unblogged** is a blogging application that unblocks any form of censorship (Blog + Unblock = **Unblogged**). It utilizes IPFS to keep user's articles persistent and censorship resistant and Markdown language for a pleasant and familiar writing interface.

Our team's goal for this hackathon is to develop a 100% decentralized platform using the power of IPFS, hence, all the tools used to support this platform is completely decentralized. Unblogged is hosted using [Fleek](https://github.com/FleekHQ), which allows **Unblogged** to be permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, and free of centralized gatekeepers. Every article that a user writes will be published and pinned on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) using [web3.storage's](https://github.com/web3-storage) SDK. This means that the user's article would be almost impossible to be censored. Each article is also minted as an NFT on Polygon which is integrated with [Tableland](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork) such that every article can be searched (using a simple SQL query) on the Homepage of Unblogged by the article's title or tags.
